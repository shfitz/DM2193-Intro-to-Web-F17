    <p>We don't have to host our own stuff (in fact it's realy a pain int he ass to do that usually). </p>
    <p>if others are hostig our content though, how can we get to it?</p>
    <p>iframes and objects are our friends in these cases, allow us to stick thngs like flash, pdfs, even other sites into our pages.</p>
    <p>way back when, people used <em>frames</em> to make websites. These were pages that has a primary page called a frameset, and all other pages would load into that page. Sort of like an ancient table or set of divs. they were a pain to manage, but were helpful for keeping some aprts of the page static while others loaded.</p>
    <p>the object element, and later the embed, were used to pop other forms of content into pages. later the iframe was introduced along with tags like video, and life became much easier.</p>
