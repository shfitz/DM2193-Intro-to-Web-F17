  <p>Your browser doesn't support HTML5 video. Here is a <a href="IMG_1790.webm">link to the video</a> instead.</p> 
</video>
    <p>The video tag has a couple parameters. the 'src' attribue is the source link to your video. The 'controls' flag turns on the browser's native control interface for video (play, pause, etc).</p>
       <p>The p element inside the video tags is called <em>fallback content</em>. it's something that older browsers will still be able to render, even if they cant show the video (thouth it might still be a nice thing to offer a link somewhere to dl the contentn).</p>
