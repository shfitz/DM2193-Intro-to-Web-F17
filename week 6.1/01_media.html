    <p>We used to be stuck with Flash or Silverlight (and even real media and windows media) for playback of video on the web. It was sort of the wild west of content plugins. There was no standard, and security issues abound</p>
    <p>HTML5 ended all that pain with the introduction of the audio and video HTML elements. There's Javascript that can control all this stuff as well, but we're gonna stay away from that for the time being.</p>
