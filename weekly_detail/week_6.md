### HTML5 Audio & Video
* `<audio>` and `<video>` elements
* Some useful attributes:
    * `autoplay` `muted` `loop` `poster="path/to/image"`
* Useful resource: archive.org ([example](https://archive.org/details/20130601014733))
* Formats supported by various browsers. See sub-features for video [here](http://caniuse.com/#feat=video) and for audio [here](http://caniuse.com/#feat=audio). It is best to include multiple sources. Example:
```
<video autoplay loop muted poster="video/stock_flowers.jpg">
    <source src="video/stock_flowers.mp4">
    <source src="video/stock_flowers.ogv">
</video>
```

### Git / GitHub
* Git - Version Control
* Key vocab from the [GitHub Glossary](https://help.github.com/articles/github-glossary/#branch): 
  * **repository** - Project folder.
  * **commit** - A revision to a file or set of files. Add files before committing them.
  * **fork** - A personal copy of another user's repository that lives on your account
  * **clone** - A copy of a repository that lives on your computer instead of on a website's server.
  * **merge** - Combine changes. Git can merge changes automatically.
  * **push** - Send your committed changes to a remote repository
  * **pull** - Fetch changes and merge them
  * **pull request** - A request to merge (pull) changes
  * **remote** - A version of a repository that is hosted somewhere else, for example on GitHub's server.
* [GitHub](http://github.com) - a website to host "git repositories"
* In class exercise:
  * Fork my repo to your github account
  * Clone it to your computer
  * Edit the index.html to add a link to your GitHub account
  * Commit your changes
  * Push your committed changes to your fork
  * Submit a pull request from your fork to the original repo. I will merge in the changes.
