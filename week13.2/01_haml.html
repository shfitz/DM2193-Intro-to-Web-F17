    <h1>HAML</h1>
      <p>HAML, aka <a href="http://haml.info/docs/yardoc/file.REFERENCE.html">HTML abstraction markup language</a>, is a markup language. The goal is to make "beautiful" markup. You write it one way, but it gets converted into HTML. </p>
      <p>To use HAML, you need to have ruby installed on your machine. If you have OSX, it's already there. If you have Linux, it's probably there as well. If you have windows, you can <a href="http://rubyinstaller.org/">install it here</a>. </p></div>
      <p>Once you're ready, in your terminal, type in <code>gem install haml</code> When you create HAML files, you need to use the <em>.haml</em> extension. To convert them to HTML, you use the  command <code>haml source.haml destination.html</code>.</p><p>Admittely, this is best utilized in a shop that relies on Ruby, but it does allow you to see the semantic layout of your pges realy easily and quickly. You won;t forget a closing tag, and even if you don't actively use it, it's a god thing to be aware of. Let's write some HAML! </p>
