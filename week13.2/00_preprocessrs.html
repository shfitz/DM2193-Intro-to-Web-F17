    <h1>Preprocessors</h1>
      <p>Thus continues our quests to become lazy programmers. CSS and HTML can becoem boring and tedious after a long period of time. Closing tags, looking up hex colors, etc etc. What a drag. Not to mention, in the aggregate, these all take up a nice chunk of time that we could be looking at cat gifs or making memes. Preprocessors re here to help us get some of our time back.</p><p>Preprocessors take one kind of data, and transform it into soemthign else. I mentioned these the other day in the context of vue.js and react.js. There are also preprocessrs for HTML and CSS. We're going to look at t2 of the more common ones for each. <a href="http://haml.info/">HAML</a> for HTML, and <a href="http://sass-lang.com/">SASS</a> for CSS.</p><p>In addition to making things more streamlned from our perspective, it makes actual pages work better.It has also led to development of tools like <a hrf="http://compass-style.org">Compass</a>. (see also <a href="http://scout-app.io/">Scout</a>)</p></div>
