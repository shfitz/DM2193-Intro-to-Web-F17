## MOOD BOARD

<p>Read the following first: http://www.webdesignerdepot.com/2008/12/why-mood-boards-matter</p>

<p>Create your mood board using photoshop or another application of your choice.</p>
<p>Use the Template Mood Board (NOT the collage mood board) in the link above as a guide. The only thing that is missing from the Template Mood Board guide is the functionality or interactivity youâ€™d also like to include in your site.</p>
<p>I'd also suggest typing the name of the font in the font section, and including the hex values by your colors.</p>


## STYLE GUIDE

<p>Read the following first: http://www.smashingmagazine.com/2010/07/21/designing-style-guidelines-for-brands-and-websites</p>

<p>Transform Your Mood Board to a Style Guide for Your Site. See example pinned on slack. However, do not use lorem ipsum. Use words/language you'd use on your site.</p>
