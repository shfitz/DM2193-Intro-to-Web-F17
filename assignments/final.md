# FINAL

#### A responsive website using a front-end framework and at least one JavaScript library.

Re-create your midterm from scratch, or start a new project, using a front-end framework and at least one JavaScript library. Design documents should be submitted as part of the final project. The project should modify / extend the framework—it should look unique and not like a cookie-cutter website. The project should focus on content, functionality, information architecture, UX and interactivity using CSS and JavaScript.

## Final Presentations

You have five minutes to present, followed by five minutes for class critique.

Focus on the goal, audience, and any supporting materials that may help convey the idea of your website. What is the goal of your website, and how do the design decisions you've made support that goal? What JS libraries did you use, and why? What were some of the challenges you faced along the way, and how did you address these challenges? How does your site behave across different types of devices \(how is it responsive\)?

## Final Format:

Upload one file \(a PDF or Slack Post\) to the HW channel. Put the hashtag \#midterm in your message. The file should **link to** each of the following deliverables—if you need to upload files, upload them to your server \(not to Slack\).

## Final Deliverables:

* **Link to your website hosted on your own \(or NYU's\) server**
* Link to your website's GitHub repository
* Project Plan
* Sitemap
* Wireframe
* Style Guide
