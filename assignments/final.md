#Final

#### A responsive website using a front-end framework and at least one JavaScript library.

Re-create your midterm from scratch, or start a new project, using a front-end framework and at least one JavaScript library. Design documents should be submitted as part of the final project. The project should modify / extend the frameworkâ€”it should look unique and not like a cookie-cutter website. The project should focus on content, functionality, and interactivity using CSS3 and JavaScript.

**More details will be posted here when the final project is announced in class.**
