#FINAL

#### A responsive website using a front-end framework and at least two JavaScript libraries.

Re-create your midterm from scratch, or start a new project, using a front-end framework and at least one JavaScript library. Design documents should be submitted as part of the final project. The project should modify / extend the framework—it should look unique and not like a cookie-cutter website. The project should focus on content, functionality, information architecture, UX and interactivity using CSS3 and JavaScript.


## Presentations (Monday 4/11/2016)
Short presentations (4 minutes total, including time for feedback). Focus on the goal, audience, and any supporting materials that may help convey the idea of your website. Supporting materials could include aspects of your Project Plan (i.e. Competitive Analysis of similar websites), Wireframes, Site Map, Style Guide, and/or Mood Board. You do not need to have all of these documents finalized but should have at least two of them ready to share with the class for feedback.
