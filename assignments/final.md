# FINAL

#### A responsive website using a front-end framework and at a JavaScript library.

Re-create your midterm from scratch, or start a new project, using a front-end framework and at least one JavaScript library. Design documents should be submitted as part of the final project. The project should modify / extend the framework—it should look unique and not like a cookie-cutter website. The project should focus on content, functionality, information architecture, UX and interactivity using CSS and JavaScript.

## Form
Pick one of the following : 

1) You may continue with your midterm idea, but you must add in enough new features for it to qualify as a new project.

- Modify Bootstrap’s CSS and JavaScript enough to make the site look like a custom build. No default bootstrap colors, fonts, etc.
- Site should be a completed site for final, no missing pages.
- Add in some sort of custom javascript or jquery outside of bootstrap defaults. Attempt to implement another external javascript framework on top of that.

2) New website.

- If you use Bootstrap as your framework, you must modify Bootstrap’s CSS and JavaScript enough to make the site look like a custom build. No default bootstrap colors, fonts, etc.
- Site should be substantial. That is, content should be weel thoguht out, there ought be multiple gaes and areas in the site as necessitated by the site's functionality.
- Complete HTML CSS site execution with JS based on functionality.

## Final Presentations

You have five minutes to present, followed by five minutes for class critique.

Focus on the goal, audience, and any supporting materials that may help convey the idea of your website. What is the goal of your website, and how do the design decisions you've made support that goal? What JS libraries did you use, and why? What were some of the challenges you faced along the way, and how did you address these challenges? How does your site behave across different types of devices \(how is it responsive\)?
