#FINAL

#### A responsive website using a front-end framework and at least two JavaScript libraries.

Re-create your midterm from scratch, or start a new project, using a front-end framework and at least one JavaScript library. Design documents should be submitted as part of the final project. The project should modify / extend the framework—it should look unique and not like a cookie-cutter website. The project should focus on content, functionality, and interactivity using CSS3 and JavaScript.


## Format:
Upload one file (a PDF or Slack Post) to the HW channel. Put the hashtag #midterm in your message. The file should **link to** each of the following deliverables—if you need to upload files, upload them to your server (not to Slack).


## Deliverables:
* **Link to your website hosted on your own (or NYU's) server**
* Link to your website's GitHub repository
* Project Plan
* Sitemap
* Wireframe
* Style Guide
