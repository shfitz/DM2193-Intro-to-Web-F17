# MIDTERM

#### A responsive website built in HTML, CSS and \(optionally\) JavaScript.

Design and build the front-end \(aka client-side\) of a website by hand-coding. Possible ideas are \(but not limited to\) a portfolio website, choose your own adventure website, website for a client, etc. Focus on content first and foremost. The website should demonstrate a grasp of HTML and CSS. It will build upon design process assignments from the first half of the course. As such, the midterm should include and adhere to the student's plans for design and information architecture.

#### Midterm propoals
In class on October 5, you will all present a midterm proposal.

Plan to show a slideshow or images that describe a simple, multipage (minimum of 4 pages) website. Do a short write up on your site as well that we can refer to for documentation. The writeup and presentation should describe the concept or idea behind site, have a site map and wireframes for the pages, illustrate an existing website you drew inspiration from, describe the concepts and skills you learned to build your site and any concepts or skills you stilll need to still learn to complete the project.

#### Presentation Schedule

Presentations will be timed. 5 minutes for presentation, 5 minutes for class critique.

#### Deliverables

**Before class on October 17**, you must provide me with links to your site _and_ a github repo. That is, I expect a direct link to a functional site as well as a link to your code.
