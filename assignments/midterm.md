#MIDTERM

####A responsive website built in HTML, CSS and (optionally) JavaScript.

Design (or redesign) and build the front-end (or client-side) of a flat file website by hand-coding. Possible ideas are (but not limited to) a portfolio website, choose your own adventure website, website for a client, etc. Focus on content first and foremost. The website should demonstrate a grasp of HTML and CSSâ€”JavaScript is optional. It will build upon design process assignments from the first half of the course. As such, the midterm should include and adhere to the student's plans for design and information architecture.

**More details will be posted here when the midterm is announced.**
