# MIDTERM

#### A responsive website built in HTML, CSS and \(optionally\) JavaScript.

Design and build the front-end \(aka client-side\) of a website by hand-coding. Possible ideas are \(but not limited to\) a portfolio website, choose your own adventure website, website for a client, etc. Focus on content first and foremost. The website should demonstrate a grasp of HTML and CSS—JavaScript is optional. It will build upon design process assignments from the first half of the course. As such, the midterm should include and adhere to the student's plans for design and information architecture.

Upload one file \(a PDF or Slack Post\) to the HW channel. Put the hashtag \#midterm in your message. The file should **link to** each of the following deliverables—if you need to upload files, upload them to your server \(not to Slack\).

## Deliverables:

* **Link to your website hosted on your own \(or NYU's\) server**
* Link to your website's GitHub repository
* Project Plan
* Sitemap
* Wireframe
* Style Guide

#### Presentation Schedule

Presentations will be timed. 5 minutes for presentation, 5 minutes for class critique.
