# MIDTERM

#### A responsive website built in HTML, CSS and \(optionally\) JavaScript.

Design and build the front-end \(aka client-side\) of a website by hand-coding. Possible ideas are \(but not limited to\) a portfolio website, choose your own adventure website, website for a client, etc. Focus on content first and foremost. The website should demonstrate a grasp of HTML and CSS. It will build upon design process assignments from the first half of the course. As such, the midterm should include and adhere to the student's plans for design and information architecture.

#### Presentation Schedule

Presentations will be timed. 5 minutes for presentation, 5 minutes for class critique.
