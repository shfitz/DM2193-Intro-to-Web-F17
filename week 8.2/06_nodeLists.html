        <h1>NodeLists</h1>
        <h2>lists/collections of nodes</h2>
        <p>The other day we looked at returning one DOM element from a page and altering it. There are other ways of getting a lot of infomration in a page and querying that. It's called a nodelist. It's almost like a collection of nodes stored in an array. They're stored in the same order they appear on the page.</p>
        <p>With a nodeList, you could selstc one element and alter it, or loops thorugh all and do soemthing with each of them. They're actually special tyoes of objects called <em>collections</em></p>
        <p>like the objects we just created, these have a couple different properties. <em>length</em> will return the number of elements in the object, while <em>item()</em> gived you access to an index number. However, it's more common to use square brackes like an array to access things.</p>
    <h2>live vs static</h2>
    <p><em>live NodeLists</em> are updated when you change elements on a page. the <em>getElementsBy</em> methods return live nodeLists. With this, you can reuse the same elements multiple times without having to reload them.</p>
    <p><em>static NodeLists</em> are not updated when/if you change its elements. The methods for generating static nodelists begin with <em>querySelector</em>.</p><p>image below taken from "javascript and jquery" by john duckett</p>
