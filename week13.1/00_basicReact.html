    <p><a href="http://reactjs.org">React.js</a> is a javascript library for building user interfaces. It's made by facebook. Like vue.js, it uses a virtual DOM to render things to screen. It is built with javascript, but has this funny thing <a href="01_jsxReact.html"> named JSX</a> that's not necessary to use, but it generally helpful. </p><p>The basic building blocks are called components, and these render to an instance of react that is bound (what they call mounted) to an element, typically a div that holds the entire page.</p>
    <script type="text/babel"> 
// because this is jsx, not javascript, we use the babel interpeter 
// (loaded above) to translate to plain old javascript for us.
