    <h1>Javascript</h1>
    <p>Hooray! We made it! This is where thigs get more interesting in the world of the internet! Recall, if you will, that HTML defines the structure of a page (the skeleton), CSS the layout and presentation (the guts and skin), and Javascript the interactivity (the soul).</p>
    <p>javascript is a high level language that is interpeted by your browser. It was born in the web, and is an integral part of it.</p>
    <p>Some of the things we can do int he page include : <ul><li>create and destroy HTML elements</li><li>assign or remove CSS styles to elements</li><li>do some maths</li><li>store user input</li><li>make paperclips and cookies</li><li>a heck of a lot more</li></ul></p>
    <p>we are going to walk before we run, and just like with CSS, we're going to get the basics down before we use any external libraries.</p>
