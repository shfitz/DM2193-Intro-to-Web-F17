    <h1>Javascript Syntax and stuff</h1>
    <p>Every statement in a javascript program ends with a semicolon. THink of it like a period atthe end of a sentence.</p>
    <h2>variables</h2>
    <p>Variables are named things that can change over time. they hold data and objects and text and numbers and probably a puppy too. We'll start with text and numbers today. Specifically <ul><li>Strings : these hold text. put double quotes around the string you're using. "I am a string!"</li><li>Integers : whole numbers like 1, 47, -968, 40145, etc.</li><li>floats : floating point numbers like 27.845, 0.3142, -1023.1, etc.</li></ul></p>
    <p>before you use a variable, you need to declare it <pre>var myVar;</pre> Unlike strongly typed languages like Java, C and C++, you don't declare a datatype in javascript. I find this t be a pain in the butt, but a lot of other people like it and I'm a crotchety old man anyhow.</p>
<p>after declaring a variable, you can give it a value (it's empty otherwise). you assign a value with an equal sign<pre>myVar = 127;</pre> you must declare a variable before you assign it a value!!</p>
<p>you can double duty instantiating and assigning a value like so : <pre>var myString="Mr. Wiggles";
var myInt = 10;
var myFloat = 3.142;</pre></p>
<p>Generaly, you'll want to declare and assign your variables at the beginning of your script. There are exceptions (as always), and we'll deal with scopinglater, but for the time being, not a bad idea to just drop it all in at the beginning.</p>
    <p>NB : A javascript variable that doesn't change is called a <em>literal</em>. You declare it the same as a regular variable.</p>
