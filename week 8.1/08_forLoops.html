        <h1>for() loops</h1>
        <p>In our quest to become lazier programmers, we always want to find a way to do things repeatedly without having to type stuff many many times. that's where our friend the for() loop comes into play. (there are other kinds, but we'll use this one or now because it's my favorite, but don't tell that to while() ).</p>
        
        <pre>for(initialization;condition;expression){
        // do something interesting here
        }</pre>
        <ul><li><em>initialization</em> is typically a variable declaration. the variable will be scoped to the for loop.</li><li><em>condition</em> is what we are evaluating. if it is true, then we will run the code int the loop, if false, we escape the loop and free.</li><li><em>expression</em> is what happen after you've successfully executed the code in the loop every time through it. Usually this is used to incrment or decrement the variable declared in the initialization statement.</li></ul>
        <p>peep this example for more.</p>
