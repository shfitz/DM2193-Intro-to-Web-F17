    <h2>996 Grid</h2>
    <p><a href="http://996grid.com/">996 Grid</a> is a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CSS_framework">CSS framework</a> with a fixed-width made up of 12 even columns. This adapts content automatically to display nicely on different screen sizes from desktop to mobile. At the largest size, the content is allowed a 970px-wide area which can be divided into equal columns of two, three, four, or six.</p>
    <p>CSS frameworks make it easy to get a site up and running with minimal hassle. They generally adhere to web standards and, generally, are in a grid of some sort. The CSS helps with layout, and oftenties there's a javascript component that can be leveraged as well, though the js bits are mostly concerned with layout and not interaction.</p>
    <p>996 is robust and easy to use (hooray!) When you download it, you'll get some basic pages and folders.
        <ul>
            <li>A basic index.html file</li>
            <li>an image folder</li>
            <li>a css folder</li>
            <li>a javascript folder named "js"</li>
        </ul>
    </p>
    <p>The CSS folder has a bunch of files in there already.
        <ul>
            <li>normalize.css : a file that 'normalizes' the css experience across browsers.</li>
            <li>base.css : HTML5 Boilerplate for consistent design across browsers</li>
            <li>grid.css : he heart of the grid system</li>
            <li>style.css : Stylesheet for user styles. Includes a variety of useful media queries. This is what we'll be editing (though it can be useful to look through the others to know what's going on under the hood)</li>
        </ul>
    </p>
<p>the js folder has a couple files in there. <a href="https://modernizr.com/">modernizr.js</a> makes sure that browsers use the components that are relevant by detecting what features they support. the empty file is for us to dump stuff if we want to.</p>
<p>Let's look at the <a href="demo.html">basic demo page</a>, then a <a href="class_demo.html">blank page</a> and start to edit that.</p>
